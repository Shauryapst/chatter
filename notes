Hi, Today I am starting this chat app

App is supposed to built on MERN stack. Since it is realtime data thing so we are going to use Socket

So first we have to learn about Socket.


SO in socket, there is combination of listen and emit, every connection has an ID.

So the question is in every chat do we use same socket connection or different based on session or chat..?

Got the idea from chatgpt -  it explained me the pros and cons.

there is one more term called "namespace" in socket, let me check that.

Got some idea, it is specific for division or to create room and all, it is not needed right now.

Till now everything is fine, I am able to connect react app to node service. But if open two different windows it creates different sockets as a result independents chats are there.
